# Title: extract-cleanup
# Description: This script will compare /opt/artemis/extracted against 3 parameters and delete files, starting with the oldest first,
# until the parameter conditions have been met. Files will never be kept longer than the MAXDAYS parameter. They may be deleted sooner
# if the THRESHOLD (max disk usage) or the max directory size is reached prior. The max disk usage will never be surpassed; however,
# the size of the directory can be restricted to a smaller capacity using the MAXSIZE parameter.
